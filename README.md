## Intro

The DevOps Administrator optimizes the use of the AWS Cloud. They help businesses operate at a larger, faster scale by managing developers and orchestrating the numerous tools and stages in the pipeline. 

This role creates and maintains processes so that teams and developers can follow the model of small, rapid releases. To do this, this role manages the release cycle to ensure that there is enough pipeline to evaluate changes that need to be made, tested, and pushed to production. Additionally, the DevOps Administrator conducts tests and backs out changes if there are issues. They have the ability to quickly roll back changes if something doesnâ€™t work.

Because the DevOps Administrator is responsible for orchestrating the pipeline, this role must be proficient with programming scripting languages, operations, QA, and testing.

## Terminology
DevOps is short for Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops). Dev are the people and processes that create software. Ops are the teams and processes that deliver and monitor the software. 
- Cultural philosophies for removing barriers and sharing end-to-end responsibility
- Processes developed for speed and quality, that streamline the way people work
- Tools that align with processes and automate repeatable tasks, making the release process more efficient and the application more reliable

## History
Traditional ways of developing software have proven slow and inefficient, and fail to support teams' efforts to quickly deliver stable, high-quality applications. Challenges of Waterfall development, monolithic applications, manual processes, and siloed team structures cause bottlenecks and delays.
